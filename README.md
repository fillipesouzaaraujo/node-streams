# Working with large masses of data via streams with Node.js

In this example we use 2 projects, a server and a simple web application.

Step 1 - In the **/app** folder.

```bash
npm i # Install library
npm run start # Run the HTML server
```

Step 2 - In the **/server** folder.

```bash
npm i # Install library
npm run dev # Run the HTML server
```
In this practical case, we send data from more than 3000 records to the front-end on demand.
